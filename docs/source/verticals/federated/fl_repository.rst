Introduction
============

The FL repository is a set of different databases, including initial ML
algorithms, already trained ML models suitable for specific data sets
and formats, averaging approaches, and auxiliary repositories for other
additional functionalities that may be needed, and are not specifically
identified yet.

Features
========

-  Provide storage for FL related data like: initial ML algorithms,
   already trained ML models suitable for specific data sets and
   formats, averaging approaches, and auxiliary repositories for other
   additional functionalities that may be needed, and are not
   specifically identified yet.
-  Provide interfaces to put and retrieve data from different components
   of the enabler.
-  Communication with other FL enablers.

Place in architecture
=====================

FL Repository enabler is one of the Federated Learning enablers that
together enable to deploy a federated learning environment.
Functionally, it operates on scalability and manageability verticals in
the Assist-IoT architecture.

User guide
==========

Interactions with this enabler are done through a REST API. In the FL
environment this enabler interacts with FL Orchestrator, FL Training
Collector and FL Local Operations.

Developer guide
===============

Components
----------

ML Algorithms Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These libraries will be used by local nodes to instantiate local
processes. The way that libraries (modules) will be stored will be
similar to the way that standard ML libraries It will made available ML
algorithms that can be used for either regular ML modelling, or for FL
modelling. Moreover, as in the well-known cases of use of external ML
modules, appropriate ML library modules are to be downloaded to the
local node, installed and used to complete model training.

FL Collectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As described in the FL Training Collector enabler, different Federated
averaging algorithms can be applied to combine local results. This
component of the FL repository will store them.

ML Model Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The repository will also persist ML trained models. These models can be
conceptualized in two “scenarios”.

-  If the enabler is installed on a local node, it will store models
   that are currently in training and/or are “in use” by this node.

-  If the repository is instantiated in some “more central location” it
   will store current versions of shared models (including initial
   models). Here, depending on the topology, shared models may represent
   a group of nodes (e.g., in the case of use of mediators), or be
   common to all nodes.

Auxiliary
~~~~~~~~~

Any other modules that may be needed to instantiate FL can be also
stored in the FL Repository. Among them possible modules related to
process verification, error handling, stopping criteria, authorization,
belong to this category.

Local communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Communication between external entities and the enabler.

Technologies
------------

RDF
~~~

W3C Resource Description Framework Description (RDF) is a standard for
representing information on the Web designed as a data model for
metadata. It is one of the foundations for semantic technologies. It
will provide flexible and adaptable model for ML algorithms metadata or
any auxiliary data. Components: ML Algorithms library, Auxiliary

FedML
~~~~~

Research library and benchmark for Federated ML containing federated
algorithms and optimizers. Components: FL Collectors, Auxiliary

Python
~~~~~~

Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language
with a set of libraries. Very popular for data analysis and ML
applications. Component: Local communication

FastAPI
~~~~~~~

A popular web microframework written in Python, FastAPI is known for
being both robust and high performing. It is based on OpenAPI
(previously Swagger) standards. Component: Local communication

MongoDB
~~~~~~~

MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database
program. Classified as a NoSQL database program. Component: ML Models
Libraries, Auxiliary
